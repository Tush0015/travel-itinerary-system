**Travel Itinerary Management System Documentation**

### Overview
This code defines a simple Travel Itinerary Management System using the Azle library. The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on travel itineraries, search for itineraries based on destinations, count the total number of itineraries, and retrieve paginated lists or those within a specific time range.

### Code Structure
1. **Dependencies:**
   - Azle: The primary library for data structures and operations.
   - UUID: Used for generating unique identifiers.
   
2. **Data Structures:**
   - `TravelItinerary`: Represents a travel itinerary with properties such as id, destination, start and end dates, creation timestamp, and optional update timestamp.
   - `TravelItineraryPayload`: Payload structure for creating or updating a travel itinerary.

3. **Storage:**
   - `travelItineraryStorage`: An instance of `StableBTreeMap` storing travel itineraries with id as the key and `TravelItinerary` as the value.

4. **Functions:**
   - `getTravelItineraries()`: Retrieves all travel itineraries.
   - `getTravelItinerary(id: string)`: Retrieves a specific travel itinerary by ID.
   - `addTravelItinerary(payload: TravelItineraryPayload)`: Adds a new travel itinerary.
   - `updateTravelItinerary(id: string, payload: TravelItineraryPayload)`: Updates an existing travel itinerary by ID.
   - `deleteTravelItinerary(id: string)`: Deletes a travel itinerary by ID.
   - `searchTravelItineraries(keyword: string)`: Searches for travel itineraries based on a keyword.
   - `countTravelItineraries()`: Counts the total number of travel itineraries.
   - `getTravelItinerariesPaginated(page: number, pageSize: number)`: Retrieves a paginated list of travel itineraries.
   - `getTravelItinerariesByTimeRange(startTime: nat64, endTime: nat64)`: Retrieves travel itineraries within a specific time range.
